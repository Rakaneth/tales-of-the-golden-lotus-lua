# Tales of the Golden Lotus, Lua + BearLibTerminal Edition

This is a Lua + BearLibTerminal port of my Tales of the Golden Lotus roguelike concept.
There will be a lot of these; they will be worked on as time and interest allow.

# Basic concept

You are a mighty warrior, the last student of your dying master who has taught you the secrets of their martial art.
You have been tasked with going out into the world and finding balance, though your master did not get a chance to tell you
before they died.
